              <p>
                I chose this site because it showcases the celebration of an
                agency's history (Bürocratik / Büro), a kind of "passion
                project" rather than a standard corporate homepage. It appears
                award-oriented (mentions "Site of the Day", "Developer Award",
                etc.), that signals high ambition in design, interactivity,
                storytelling. Also its interesting from a UX / narrative /
                branding point of view: telling history via web medium, not just
                static content. It gives a more creative, less conventional
                canvas for analysis (less constrained by typical business
                goals). So it's a good candidate to inspect how branding,
                storytelling, and interaction are handled in a non-standard
                site.

              <h3 class="section-title">Initial Impression</h3>
              <p>
                Immediately, there's curiosity and a sense of craftsmanship. The
                framing "18 Years of Büro" and "Our eccentric story" evoke
                personality, narrative, legacy. The design leans toward being
                "artful," expressive, somewhat whimsical. It feels like
                scrolling through a visual memoir or curated portfolio. It gives
                a boutique, boutique/atelier feel – "this is made with care,
                with character" rather than a cold corporate landing. There's
                also a slight tension: because of the ambitious, dense content,
                there's a risk of overwhelm or "too much going on," but overall,
                it seems to lean into that with confidence.

            <div class="analysis-section">
              <h3 class="section-title">Structure</h3>
              <p>
                The site is organized into chapters (Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4) – time
                periods (2004–2012, 2013–2017, etc.). The query parameter
                ?chapter1 obviously selects the first chapter. Within each
                chapter, there is a timeline / narrative flow: year markers,
                story segments, images, anecdotes. There is a menu toggle
                ("Open/close menu") which likely offers navigation to other
                chapters and external links (social, parent site). The content
                is layered: text blocks interspersed with imagery, often with
                transitions or scroll cues. There is a progression: you scroll
                (or otherwise navigate) from "Where it all begins" onward,
                revealing successive narrative segments. So structurally, it's a
                long-scroll / storytelling site partitioned into chapters &
                sections. The primary navigation is via chapters, and secondary
                via vertical scroll within chapters.

                Visual (Palette, Typography, Branding)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Palette / Color:</strong> The base is mostly a dark /
                muted / minimal scheme (dark backgrounds, sometimes black or
                near black, with light text). Accent use of color (white,
                off-white, occasionally color in imagery). The contrast is
                strong. Imagery is often in photographic or grayscale tones,
                aligning with a curated, expressive aesthetic.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Typography:</strong> The typography is strong, likely
                using a large, bold serif or humanist font for headings, paired
                with simpler readable text for body. There is a clear
                typographic hierarchy: heading sizes, spacing, line breaks,
                etc., are used to give rhythm to the narrative. The style leans
                expressive, not strictly minimal—characterful fonts likely
                chosen to reflect brand personality.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Branding:</strong> The site feels like an extension of
                the agency's visual identity: quirky, somewhat rebellious,
                personal. The identity is not "safe" – it leans into stories,
                illustrations, perhaps custom elements. The "Büro / Bürocratik"
                name is woven into the narrative, and the "18 Years" frame gives
                the branding a milestone quality. Visually, the site feels
                cohesive, consistent, and well considered; it doesn't feel like
                disparate parts thrown together.

                Interaction (Animations, Effects, Microinteractions)
              </h3>
              <p>
                There are scroll-based transitions: as you scroll, new content
                fades, slides, or reveals. The narrative evolves gradually. Some
                images or text blocks may animate (fade in, slide in) as the
                user gets to them. (I observed "keep scrolling to dive in"
                cues). The menu toggle (Open/close menu) is itself interactive.
                Microinteractions (hover states, small cues) likely exist but
                are subtle (e.g. links, image hover) – the design doesn't scream
                "microinteraction everywhere," but where they exist they
                probably serve to delight without distracting. The site uses
                scroll progression to pace storytelling; transitions and
                layering help control focus. These interactive touches help
                maintain engagement through long scroll – they break monotony.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The narrative is clear: you know you're reading the story of the
                agency over time. The chapter structure helps you orient
                yourself in "which era" you're reading. However, because the
                design is expressive, some text overlays or transitions may at
                times reduce legibility (depending on background image
                contrast). That might be a concern for some users. Without deep
                inspection, I can't confirm full WCAG compliance (alt texts,
                keyboard nav, ARIA labels, etc.). Because of the heavy reliance
                on visual layering and transitions, care is needed to ensure
                screen readers / high contrast / reduced motion modes work well.
                The contrast (light text on dark background) is relatively high,
                which is good, but some image overlays might reduce contrast in
                parts. The site is media-rich (many images) and effects heavy,
                so initial load might carry overhead. The design gives cues
                ("keep scrolling") to manage expectation. Lazy loading of images
                or deferring offscreen content would help; whether they do is a
                technical detail I can't fully see without dev tools. Overall,
                usability is solid for an audience that expects "experiential /
                portfolio / design site," though for general audiences some
                tradeoffs may exist.

                Technical (Speed, Semantics, Core Web Vitals)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Given the number of large images and transitions, performance
                risk is moderate. If the developers optimize (image compression,
                lazy loading, code splitting, minimal heavy scripts) they can
                mitigate that. The funnel is long: the user must scroll through
                many segments – retaining performance across the full scroll is
                essential. I saw heading levels (e.g. "## Where it all begins.")
                in the markup. The site likely uses sections, articles, figure
                and figcaption for images. But there could be opportunities for
                richer semantic structure (ARIA for dynamic parts, landmarks) if
                not already present. Proper alt text on images, appropriate tags
                on interactive elements, keyboard navigability – these are
                essential. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): the hero or first
                visible section must load quickly; heavy images or scripts may
                delay that. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): transitions and
                loading images should avoid sudden layout jumps; placeholders or
                reserved space help. First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to
                Next Paint (INP): even during scroll, the site should keep
                responsiveness. Long scripts or heavy sequential loads would be
                harmful. Given the site is meant for award-level design, I
                expect attention was paid to these, but only a metrics audit
                would confirm.

                Excellence Criteria (Creativity, Content, UX)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The site is unabashedly creative. It uses narrative, novel
                transitions, expressive visuals, and personal storytelling. It
                avoids the "template portfolio" trap; it feels unique to Büro's
                voice and history. The chapter metaphor is a strong device,
                turning time into spatial exploration. The content is rich: it's
                not just "we did this project," but "here's how we evolved, what
                we learned, who we are." It weaves in personality, anecdotes,
                even vulnerabilities (e.g. mentions struggles, staff changes).
                The images complement the text, reinforcing the narrative. The
                experience is immersive and guided. The user feels led through a
                journey, not left to wander aimlessly. The pacing (transitions,
                scroll cues) helps manage attention. The navigation (chapters)
                gives structure, while the vertical scroll gives flow. For its
                target user (design/interested visitor), the UX feels elevated.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Narrative coherence: the storytelling is strong, grounded,
                  personal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visual identity and consistency: the design, typography,
                  imagery all cohere to a strong brand voice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creative interactivity: transitions, scroll effects, chapter
                  structure keep engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ambitious scope: trying to make a "site as memoir" is bold,
                  and they mostly succeed.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Performance overhead: heavy images and animations can slow
                  things down, especially on weaker devices or slow networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility challenges: expressive designs often put
                  legibility or assistive usability at risk unless mitigated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overwhelm / density: for casual visitors, the volume of
                  content or visual transitions may feel heavy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  SEO / content findability: narrative sites sometimes
                  deprioritize more "practical" pages (services, case studies) –
                  depending on whether this is a standalone microsite or part of
                  a larger site, discoverability might be less ideal.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Storytelling is a powerful structure: framing brand history
                  via chapters gives you a direction and pacing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transitions + scroll effects, when used judiciously, can
                  maintain interest without distracting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always balance ambition with usability: performance,
                  legibility, and accessibility are non-negotiable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even "portfolio / celebratory" sites benefit from strong
                  semantic structure and optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let personality come through – it humanizes the brand, makes

                It claims a bold, personal identity: "SofaKnows: Creative
                director, CEO, Artist." This suggests the site is a personal /
                brand portfolio or "persona" site, which makes it interesting to
                analyze how the individual is presented. It's a contrast to more
                agency/collective sites (like Büro above) – more individual,
                perhaps minimal, more direct. It's valuable to compare a
                personal creative site with a narrative-driven agency site, to
                see different design choices, constraints, tradeoffs.

                The name "SofaKnows" is playful, memorable, idiosyncratic. That
                suggests the author leans toward personality, not corporate
                opacity. The landing is minimal: mostly the name repeated,
                preload images, etc., which gives a somewhat enigmatic,
                mysterious impression. It makes you want to click / explore to
                see what's "behind the curtain." It feels bold in restraint –
                not trying to overwhelm you, but rather to intrigue.

                The homepage is extremely minimal (almost blank with repeated
                "Sofaknows.com" text). From what I saw, there is a pattern of
                preload / background images queued. There is no obvious
                traditional navigation menu visible immediately (at least on the
                homepage). Likely, the structure is navigated via scroll or
                hidden menu or overlays (a "reveal" style). Content is probably
                organized by sections (works / projects / biography) but hidden
                behind interactions. Because I saw very little content displayed
                immediately, the structure is implicit, relying on discovery /
                exploration rather than explicit menus.

                Visual (Palette, Typography, Branding)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Palette / Color:</strong> Very minimal – likely strong
                use of whitespace or dark/neutral backgrounds (but since I see a
                blank-ish or neutral view, the palette emphasizes minimalism).
                Preloaded images suggest that richer visuals appear further into
                the site; the initial screen is spare.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Typography:</strong> The repetition of "Sofaknows.com"
                in a simple text block suggests a clean, minimal sans serif font
                (or a neutral readable typeface). Typography seems understated,
                letting other elements (images, transitions) take visual
                priority.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Branding:</strong> The branding is the name itself:
                "SofaKnows" as an identity. The repetitive textual display gives
                emphasis: you see the name, again and again, staking out
                ownership of the domain / identity. It's more abstract /
                conceptual branding – the experience is the brand, not a logo +
                tagline style.

              <p>
                The site uses preload of images, which hints that transitions or
                visual reveals are part of the experience. Likely scroll or
                hover reveal interactions (images appear as you scroll or enter
                a section). Because the homepage is so minimal, the "entrance"
                or "opening" interaction is key – what you do to move forward
                will define your sense of interactivity. Microinteractions may
                include hover states, subtle transitions between sections, fade
                / parallax effects, etc., though I didn't directly observe them
                in the landing state. Given the spare first view, the
                interactions likely emphasize "reveal" and discovery.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Clarity:</strong> The minimal landing is intriguing, but
                may leave some users unsure what to do next (scroll? click?).
                That ambiguity can add mystique but also friction. Once
                interactions are made clear (e.g. a scroll cue or "enter /
                start" button), clarity improves.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Because of the minimal initial
                content, the barrier is low, but the reveal interactions must be
                accessible (keyboard, screen readers). Any images loaded later
                need alt attributes, and interactive elements need ARIA
                roles/labels. Transitions should allow reduced motion
                preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Loading / Perceived Performance:</strong> Preloading
                images is a double-edged sword: it can smooth transitions if
                done well, but can slow the initial load. If images are
                optimized and lazy-loaded, the impact is limited. It seems the
                developer anticipates this, hence preload hints.

                Technical (Speed, Semantics, Core Web Vitals)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Because the landing is light (text only), initial load might be
                fast, which is good. However, when moving deeper (revealing
                images, sections), asset management is crucial to keep
                performance smooth. Semantic markup: from the visible source, I
                saw mostly repeated "Sofaknows.com" text in HTML. That suggests
                minimal structural markup on the landing. For deeper pages, good
                semantic structure is needed (sections, headings, landmarks).
                Core Web Vitals concerns: the first visible "largest" element
                (maybe background, hero image) must appear quickly. Layout
                shifts as content arrives must be minimized. Interactions
                (scroll, click) must remain responsive even as heavy assets
                load.

              <p>
                The approach is bold by minimalism: making the empty / sparse
                the tension, the intrigue. The identity is embedded in the
                experience, not just in visuals. It's a more "art piece"
                approach – expression over convention. There's minimal content
                on the landing; content presumably emerges deeper. The scarcity
                of content at first is a statement: perhaps content is curated,
                meaningful, not ornamental. The UX is experimental. It trades
                off some clarity or instant guidance in favor of exploration and
                discovery. For the right audience (designers, curious visitors),
                that can be engaging. For general users, it might be
                disorienting.

                  Ambiguity for users: without clear cues, some visitors may not

                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility / discoverability issues: hidden navigation or
                  interactions may impede users with less tolerance for
                  experimentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance risk deeper down: larger assets or heavy
                  transitions might slow down the deeper parts of the site.
                </li>
                <li>
                  SEO / content density risk: minimal content can make it harder
                  for search engines or for visitors seeking concrete
                  information (e.g. services, contact).

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Minimalism can be powerful—but it must be balanced with enough
                  guidance so users aren't lost.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The "entrance" of the site (first view / opening interaction)
                  is crucial – it sets expectations and direction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Preloading and transition planning should be smart: you want
                  smooth reveal without jarring loads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Personal / expressive sites benefit when content emerges
                  gradually but meaningfully; you don't need to overwhelm all at
                  once.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always check that hidden interactions remain accessible, and

                It's a food / culinary brand ("Real fats, real flavor") with an
                environmental / sustainable message («without depleting Earth's
                resources … without animals, hormones, antibiotics, farmland or
                fertilizers»). So it combines product, mission, branding,
                ethics—all rich material for analysis. It appears to be a more
                modern brand/site, likely with interesting visuals, narrative,
                mission alignment. Good contrast to a portfolio or agency site.
                It gives an opportunity to see how sustainability + food
                branding + digital UX converge.

                Immediately, there is a sense of naturalness, purity, and
                craftsmanship. Words like "Pure, versatile, sustainably-made
                fats" set a tone of ethical product design and care. The
                language ("Without depleting Earth's resources … Without animals
                …") conveys strong green / ethical credentials—perhaps minimal
                environmental impact. That can evoke trust, respect, maybe even
                admiration. Also a bit of novelty: you're not expecting a "fats"
                company; calling out fats (butter / palm oil alternative etc) is
                unusual, which lends curiosity. Overall, the impression is one
                of artisan quality + ethical intention + modern branding.

                There is a top navigation bar/menu with links: Home, Process,
                Foods, Mission, Journal, Contact, plus social / press / legal
                links. The homepage has large sections: a hero ("Pure,
                versatile, sustainably-made fats …") + "Our Process", "Our
                Foods", "In the press", etc. The site uses scroll to reveal
                content: as you move down, more sections appear. The hero is
                followed by process, foods, press mentions, then a call to
                action (join newsletter) etc. There's a clear mission / values

              </h3>
              <p>
                The site uses strong visuals (images) of food / product. The
                many image tags in the source suggest high visual richness. The
                palette seems clean and modern: probably neutral backgrounds
                with richer tones from the product photography. The wording
                "real fats, real flavor" suggests warm tones, natural color in
                images. Typography seems clean, modern, with readable headings
                and body copy. The headings emphasize the key value propositions
                ("Pure, versatile, sustainably-made fats", "Real fats, real
                flavor") which are short and bold. Use of headings ("###")
                suggests hierarchical typography; clear segments. The brand
                identity is strong: ethical, sustainable, artisan. The writing
                ("reviving an elemental process … sustaining our planet")
                positions it not just as a food brand but as a movement or
                mission. The product is the branding: words + imagery about what
                they don't do (no animals, no fertilizers, etc.) as well as what
                they are.

                episode") etc. There may be an embedded video ("Watch Episode")
                which implies media interaction. Hover states for navigation /
                images likely. Social links, press kit etc. Scrolling reveals
                sections; likely images fade in or parallax; interactive cues
                ("join now") etc.

                The message is very clear: what they do, how they do it, why it
                matters. The navigation is straightforward; the sections are
                logically labelled (Process, Foods, Mission, Journal). From the
                HTML visible, images are present; I can't see alt text from the
                snippet, so I can't confirm. Contrast: text seems plain and
                readable. Unless overlay on images reduces contrast, likely
                acceptable. Legal / privacy / terms etc present, social
                media/press kit visible—this helps transparency and trust.
                Multiple images are loaded; heavy visuals may slow the page. If
                images are optimized, lazy loaded, etc., then acceptable. If
                not, might be slow on mobile / low-bandwidth.

                No concrete metrics available, but possible risks: LCP delay if

                content load causing shifts. Semantics: sections are well
                differentiated ("Our Process", "Our Foods", etc.). The nav uses
                standard anchor links. Legal / privacy links are in footer.
                That's good. Use of a video ("Watch Episode") may introduce

              </h3>
              <p>
                The positioning ("real fats, real flavor") with sustainability,
                and especially the negative definitions ("without …") give a
                strong, distinct voice. The concept of delivering "foods we
                love" but made differently is appealing and creative. Strong
                product content: process + mission + foods gives a full picture:
                what the product is, why it matters, how it's made. The
                inclusion of "Journal" suggests ongoing storytelling, building
                community / transparency. The design seems user-friendly: clear
                navigation, readable content, compelling imagery. The call to
                action (Join Now / Newsletter) is positioned near the bottom but
                visible. For someone interested in sustainable food, the path
                from learning "what" to "why" to "how to get involved / buy" is
                evident.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Very clear mission + messaging. You immediately understand
                  what Savor is about.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strong branding: ethical, natural, modern. The visual + copy
                  reinforce each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Good structural layout: hero → process → product → social
                  proof (press) → community (journal, newsletter).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transparency: mission, terms/privacy, press kit, etc. are
                  visible.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Performance risk: many images, possibly video, plus high
                  fidelity visuals can slow load times, especially on mobile or
                  weaker networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility risk: images needs alt text; overlays or
                  background-image text could reduce readability. If video lacks
                  captions or accessible controls, that's a concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engagement risk: if visitors don't immediately find what they
                  want (e.g. pricing, shop), there may be friction. The "Foods"
                  page is present but depending on how it's organized could be
                  deep.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Combining product + mission is powerful; being explicit about
                  what you don't do is as informative as what you do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visual richness enhances branding but must be balanced with
                  performance optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transparent navigation (including legal, press, etc.) builds
                  trust.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintaining clarity while preserving brand voice is a strong
                  asset.

                It's a portfolio site by a "Creative Developer" – combining
                coding + design, which often yields interesting UX /
                interactivity trade-offs. The "Projects" section gives a good
                cross-section of work; its structure, presentation, and layout
                are likely to reveal how Stefan wants to position himself
                professionally. It's relevant for comparing how individual
                creatives organize & present work, as opposed to product or
                agency sites.

                Professional, clean, minimalist. The page gives off a sense of
                precision & clarity. There is a strong sense of craftsmanship:
                the interface seems thought-through, purposeful. Also there's an
                impression of high quality: the labels of projects (Cartier,
                Breakthrough Energy, UNDP, etc.) suggest serious clients, which
                gives credibility. Slightly formal – less playful, more polished
                / refined.

              <p>
                The page is a list of projects. I count 19 ("/19") in the
                Projects page. Each project is given a title; it appears as
                clickable/interactive elements (probably linking through to more
                detail). E.g. "365 – A Year of Cartier", "Pluto XR Experience",
                "Neko Healthcare", etc. There is header navigation: Intro /
                Projects / About. Contact info is present ("Available for
                freelance projects: hello@..."), plus social link (LinkedIn) is
                visible. The page numbering "01 /19" suggests some pagination or
                current index when selecting projects, or a visual cue of
                progress. Thus, structure is straightforward: the projects are
                primary content, preceded by navigation and accompanied by
                contact / credentials.

              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Palette:</strong> Likely minimal, leaning toward
                monochrome / neutral tones, letting project thumbnails & content
                stand out. The emphasis seems on clarity rather than decorative
                color. Background likely clean (white or very light) with
                dark/black typography.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Typography:</strong> Clear hierarchy: project names are
                prominent; navigation items are less prominent but visible. Font
                choice seems modern, sans serif, clean, readable.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Branding:</strong> The brand is "Stefan Vitasović –
                Creative Developer, Stockholm, Sweden." The positioning is
                clear: international, creative & technical competence. Projects
                are high-profile / varied, which underscores versatility. The
                "Available for freelance projects" line emphasizes openness &
                availability, reinforcing that this is both portfolio & call to
                action.

              <p>
                The "01 /19" suggests that perhaps when you hover or click,
                project count / progress updates (a microinteraction). Likely
                hover feedback on project items (e.g. image or title
                animations). Possibly smooth page transitions, or project detail
                overlays. The navigation items (Intro / Projects / About)
                probably have hover or selection states. Though from the static
                source I saw, I didn't observe JS code or specific animations;
                but typical portfolio-sites of this style often employ subtle
                transitions.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Very clear what this page is: "Projects." Users know where they
                are, can see what kinds of work is done. Project names are
                descriptive; client names or project types often included. From
                source snippet, I can't confirm presence of alt-text for images
                (if images are involved) or whether keyboard navigation is
                robust. The text is likely well contrastive (dark on light).
                Listing of 19 items is moderate; if project items include large
                images, that could slow things, but if thumbnails are optimized
                / lazy loaded, then likely acceptable. Because the design is
                minimal, initial paint likely quick.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Semantics: The HTML class / tags seem to use sectioning (list of
                projects), headings ("## …") etc. That helps. The "Available for
                freelance projects" line in source is plainly in text, good for
                semantics. Core Web Vitals possible issues: LCP if a large
                project image or banner loads; CLS if layout shifts when images
                load; FID/INP is probably low risk if interactions are light.
                Also the count "/19" indicates dynamic behavior; making sure
                that dynamic content doesn't block rendering or interactivity is
                important.

              <p>
                The design is polished and restrained. The creativity lies in
                selection of projects, variety, and clean presentation rather
                than flashy visuals. The "progress count" (01/19) is a nice
                touch, giving you a sense of scale, progress, discovery. Good
                mix of project names; likely each has case studies or detail
                pages. The titles span various industries / types. Contact info
                and credentials are visible, making conversion / outreach easy.
                Likely smooth, easy to navigate: clear sections; clicking to
                project detail; ability to contact. Minimal distractions; visual
                hierarchy likely supports quick scanning. The navigation is
                simple but effective.

              <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Potential lack of descriptive preview / thumbnails: if project
                  titles alone are shown (without images or brief summaries),
                  users might be less motivated to click.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility / performance could be challenging if images are
                  large or not optimized.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Might feel perhaps "safe" rather than adventurous; less visual
                  flair might reduce memorability for some visitors.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Simplicity in a portfolio can work very well – clean design +
                  strong content = clarity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Showing progress / count ("01/19") gives users a sense of
                  journey / scale, encouraging exploration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always include easy contact / freelance availability; drop
                  barriers for someone who wants to reach out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using project titles that are descriptive helps, but pairing
                  with visuals (screenshots / thumbnails) enhances engagement.
                </li>
