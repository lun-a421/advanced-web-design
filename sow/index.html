              <p>
                I chose this site because it showcases the celebration of an
                agency's history (Büro), a kind of "passion project" rather than
                a standard corporate homepage. They tell their story in a close
                and interactive way, they even use sound which capturated me.
                They use a interactive timeline which helps them visually tell
                the history via web medium, not just static content. It gives a
                more creative, less conventional canvas for analysis (less
                constrained by typical business goals).

              <p>
                Immediately, there's curiosity and a sense of craftsmanship. The
                framing "18 Years of Büro" and "Our eccentric story" evoke
                personality, narrative and legacy. The design leans toward being
                "artful," expressive, and somewhat whimsical. It feels like
                scrolling through a visual memoir or curated portfolio. It gives
                a boutique feel, something made with care, and with character,
                rather than a cold corporate landing. There's also a slight
                tension: because of the ambitious, dense content, there's a risk
                of overwhelm or "too much going on" but overall, it seems to
                lean into that with confidence.

              <h3 class="section-title">Structure</h3>
              <p>
                The site is organized into years, as it is a timeline. As the
                user scrolls the timeline goes forward and it appears the year
                markers, story segments, images, and anecdotes. There is a menu
                toggle which likely offers navigation to other chapters and
                external links. The content is layered: text blocks interspersed
                with imagery, often with transitions or scroll cues. There is a
                progression: you scroll from "Where it all begins" onward,
                revealing successive narrative segments. So structurally, it's a
                long-scroll site partitioned into chapters (years) and sections.

                Visual (Palette, Typography, Branding)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Palette / Color:</strong> The base is mostly a minimal
                scheme. The backgroud is mostly white or a type of cream with
                black text, so the contrast is strong. Imagery is often in
                colors or with a filter which aligns with the aesthetic.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Typography:</strong> The typography is strong, likely
                using a large, bold serif or humanist font for headings, paired
                with simpler readable Sans serif text for body. There is a clear
                typographic hierarchy: heading sizes, spacing, line breaks,
                etc.,are used to give rhythm to the narrative. The style leans
                expressive, not strictly minimal characterful fonts likely
                chosen to reflect brand personality.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Branding:</strong> The site feels like an extension of
                the agency's visual identity: quirky, somewhat rebellious,
                personal. The identity is not "safe" it leans into stories,
                illustrations, perhaps custom elements. The "Büro" name is woven
                into the narrative, and the "18 Years" frame gives the branding
                a milestone quality. Visually, the site feels cohesive,
                consistent, and well considered; it doesn't feel like disparate
                parts thrown together.

                Interaction (Animations, Effects, Microinteractions)
              </h3>
              <p>
                There are scroll-based transitions: as you scroll, new content
                fades, slides, or reveals. The narrative evolves gradually. Some
                images or text blocks may animate (fade in, slide in) as the
                user gets to them. The menu toggle is itself interactive.
                Microinteractions (hover states, small cues) likely exist but
                are subtle (links, image hover) the design doesn't scream
                "microinteraction everywhere," but where they exist they
                probably serve to delight without distracting. The site uses
                scroll progression to pace storytelling; transitions and
                layering help control focus. These interactive touches help
                maintain engagement through long scroll, they break monotony.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The narrative is clear, you know you're reading the story of the
                agency over time. The chapter (year) structure helps you orient
                yourself in "which era" you're reading. However, because the
                design is expressive, some text overlays or transitions may at
                times reduce legibility (depending on background image
                contrast). That might be a concern for some users. Because of
                the heavy reliance on visual layering and transitions, care is
                needed to ensure that high contrast, reduced motion modes work
                well. The contrast (dark text on light background) is relatively
                high, which is good, but some image overlays might reduce
                contrast in some parts. The site has many images and effects, so
                initial load might carry overhead. Lazy loading of images or
                deferring offscreen content would help. Overall, usability is
                solid for an audience that expects an experimetal and unique
                site.

                Technical (Speed, Semantics, Core Web Vitals)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Given the number of large images and transitions, performance
                risk is moderate. The funnel is long: the user must scroll
                through many segments, retaining performance across the full
                scroll is essential. The site likely uses sections, articles,
                figure and figcaption for images. But there could be
                opportunities for richer semantic structure if not already
                present. Proper alt text on images, appropriate tags on
                interactive elements, keyboard navigability, these are
                essential. The first visible section must load quickly; heavy
                images or scripts may delay that. Transitions and loading images
                should avoid sudden layout jumps; placeholders or reserved space
                help. Even during scroll, the site should keep responsiveness.
                Long scripts or heavy sequential loads would be harmful. Given
                the site is meant for award level design, I expect attention was
                paid to these, but only a metrics audit would confirm.

                Excellence Criteria (Creativity, Content, UX)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The site is unabashedly creative. It uses narrative,
                transitions, expressive visuals, and personal storytelling. It
                avoids the "template portfolio" trap; it feels unique to Büro's
                voice and history. The timeline metaphor is a strong device,
                turning time into spatial exploration. The content is rich: it's
                not just "we did this project," but "here's how we evolved, what
                we learned, who we are." It weaves in personality, anecdotes,
                even vulnerabilities (mentions struggles, staff changes). The
                images complement the text, reinforcing the narrative. The
                experience is immersive and guided. The user feels led through a
                journey, not left to wander aimlessly. The pacing (transitions,
                scroll cues) helps manage attention. The navigation (chapters)
                gives structure, while the vertical scroll gives flow. For its
                target user (design interested visitor), the UX feels elevated.

              <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Narrative coherence: the storytelling is strong, grounded,
                  personal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visual identity and consistency: the design, typography,

                </li>
                <li>
                  Creative interactivity: transitions, scroll effects, chapter
                  structure keep engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ambitious scope: trying to make a "site as memoir" is bold,
                  and they mostly succeed.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Performance overhead: heavy images and animations can slow
                  things down, especially on weaker devices or slow networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility challenges: expressive designs often put
                  legibility or assistive usability at risk unless mitigated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overwhelming: for casual visitors, the volume of content or
                  visual transitions may feel heavy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Content findability: narrative sites sometimes deprioritize
                  more "practical" pages (services, case studies),
                  discoverability might be less ideal.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Storytelling is a powerful structure: framing brand history
                  via chapters (years) gives you a direction and pacing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transitions + scroll effects, can maintain interest without
                  distracting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Always balance ambition with usability: performance,
                  legibility, and accessibility are non-negotiable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even "portfolio/celebratory" sites benefit from strong
                  semantic structure and optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As personality comes through it humanizes the brand, makes it

                I chose it as it claims a bold, personal identity: "SofaKnows:
                Creative director, CEO, Artist." This suggests the site is a
                personal site, which makes it interesting to analyze how the
                individual is presented. It's a contrast to more
                agency/collective sites.

              <p>
                The name "SofaKnows" is playful and memorable. That suggests the
                author leans toward personality. The landing is minimal: mostly
                the name repeated, preload images, etc., which gives a somewhat
                enigmatic, mysterious impression. It makes you want to click /
                explore. It feels bold in restraint, not trying to overwhelm
                you, but rather to intrigue.

              <p>
                The homepage is extremely minimal, almost blank with repeated
                "Sofaknows.com" text. There is a pattern of preload / background
                images queued. There is no obvious traditional navigation menu
                visible immediately (at least on the homepage). Likely, the
                structure is navigated via scroll or hidden menu or overlays (a
                "reveal" style). Content is organized by sections
                (works,projects,biography) but hidden behind interactions.
                Because you see very little content displayed immediately, the
                structure is implicit, relying on discovery and exploration
                rather than explicit menus.

              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Palette / Color:</strong> Strong use of white or dark
                backgrounds, the palette emphasizes minimalism. Preloaded images
                suggest that richer visuals appear further into the site, The
                images are the ones that have the main attention thats why the
                use of minimal color palette.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Typography:</strong> The repetition of "Sofaknows.com"
                in a simple text block is in a clean,readable, and minimal sans
                serif font. The typography is understated, therefore letting
                other elements (images, transitions) take visual priority.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Branding:</strong> The branding is the name itself:
                "SofaKnows" as an identity. The repetitive display of this gives
                emphasis. You see the name, again and again, reminding your of
                the sites identity. The branding aims for a more abstract/
                conceptual approach,where the experience is the brand, not a
                logo.

                The site uses preload of images, which hints that transitions or
                visual reveals are part of the experience. Likely scroll or
                hover reveal interactions (images appear as you scroll or enter
                a section). Furthermore, because of the simplicity of the
                homepage, the "entrance" or "opening" interaction is key for
                your personal experience. What you do to move forward will
                define your sense of interactivity. Microinteractions include
                hover states, subtle transitions between sections, fade effects,
                etc.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Clarity:</strong> The minimal landing is intriguing, but
                may leave some users unsure what to do next (scroll? click?).
                That ambiguity can add mystery but also friction. Once
                interactions are made clear (e.g. a scroll cue or "enter /
                start" button), clarity improves.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Because of the minimal initial
                content, the barrier is low, but the reveal interactions must be
                accessible (keyboard, screen readers). A weak point could be
                that reaching specific pieces of information is very complex,
                because there is a lot of scattered information on the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Loading / Perceived Performance:</strong> Preloading
                images has a risk: it can smooth transitions, but can slow the
                initial load. However in this case, the images have been
                optimized and lazy-loaded, therefore reducing the impact.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Because the landing is simple (text only), initial load is fast,
                which is good. However, when moving deeper (revealing images,
                sections), asset management is crucial to keep performance
                smooth. For deeper pages, good semantic structure is needed
                (sections, headings, landmarks). A problem could be that the
                first visible "largest" element must appear quickly, in the case
                of the hero page. Layout shifts as content arrives must be
                minimized. Interactions (scroll, click) must remain responsive
                even as heavy assets load.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The approach is bold yet minimalistic. The scarcity of content
                at first is a statement: perhaps content is curated and
                meaningful, not ornamental. This sparse information creates
                intrigue, making the user emerge deeper, where he will find the
                most important content. The UX is experimental. It trades off
                some clarity or instant guidance in favor of exploration and
                discovery. This web is built like an art piece, the identity of
                person behind it is embedded in the users experience, not just
                in visuals. Furthermore, it is meant for the right audience
                (designers, curious visitors), that can find this to be
                engaging, since for general users, it might be disorienting.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility: hidden navigation or interactions may impede

                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance risk deeper down: larger assets or heavy

                </li>
                <li>
                  Content density risk: minimal content can make it harder for

              <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Minimalism can be powerful, but it must be balanced with

                <li>
                  Preloading and transition planning should be smart: you want

                </li>
                <li>
                  Personal expressive sites benefit when content emerges

                This site belongs to a culinary brand with the slogan “Real
                fats, real flavor,” which stands out for combining food and
                sustainability in a fresh, modern way. Its message focuses on
                creating products without harming the planet: no animals,
                hormones, antibiotics, farmland, or fertilizers, so it’s not
                just about the product itself but also about its mission,
                ethics, and branding. The website likely features strong visuals
                and storytelling that align with its values, offering an
                interesting contrast to more typical portfolio or agency sites.
                Overall, it’s a great example of how sustainability, food
                branding, and digital UX can merge into one cohesive experience.

                The first impression of the site immediately gives off a feeling
                of naturalness, purity, and craftsmanship. Phrases like “Pure,
                versatile, sustainably-made fats” set a tone that reflects
                ethical product design and genuine care for the environment. The
                language used, such as “Without depleting Earth’s resources” and
                “Without animals”, strongly emphasizes sustainability and
                ethical values, which helps build trust and even admiration from
                the viewer. There’s also something unexpected and intriguing
                about a brand focused specifically on “fats,” as it’s not a
                common product category to highlight, adding an element of
                curiosity. Overall, the site feels like a blend of artisan
                quality, ethical purpose, and modern branding.

              <p>
                The site relies heavily on strong, high-quality visuals,
                especially images of food and product shots, which immediately
                draw attention and convey richness. The overall palette feels
                clean and modern, likely using neutral backgrounds that let the
                warm, natural tones of the product photography stand out. This
                fits perfectly with the brand’s message: “Real fats, real
                flavor” and reinforces a sense of authenticity and simplicity.
                The typography is also clean and contemporary, with clear
                hierarchy between bold, concise headings and readable body text.
                Phrases like “Pure, versatile, sustainably-made fats” and “Real
                fats, real flavor” stand out as key statements that relate back
                to the design. The brand identity feels cohesive and
                intentional, ethical, sustainable, and artisan. The language
                used (“reviving an elemental process,” “sustaining our planet”)
                elevates the brand beyond just food, positioning it as part of a
                broader movement or mission. Overall, both the visuals and the
                tone of the site make the product itself the center of the
                brand—celebrating not only what it is, but also what it
                consciously avoids being.

              <p>
                The site seems to include subtle interactions and animations
                that enhance the experience. The hero or landing images have
                transitions, and there’s an embedded video with a “Watch
                Episode” prompt, adding media interaction. Hover effects are
                used on navigation links, images, and social or press links to
                give feedback and guide the user. Scrolling through the site
                reveals new sections, which fade in, and calls to action like
                “Join Now” provide interactive cues. Overall, these
                microinteractions and subtle animations help make the experience
                dynamic without overwhelming the user.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The site communicates its message very clearly, showing what the
                brand does, how it does it, and why it matters. Navigation is
                straightforward, with logically labeled sections like Process,
                Foods, Mission, and Journal, making it easy to explore. The text
                itself is plain and readable, even when placed on top of images
                and videos. Legal pages, privacy policies, terms, and visible
                social media or press links add transparency and build trust.
                The site uses multiple images, which could slow loading times,
                however performance should remain acceptable thanks to lazy-low,
                even on mobile or slower connections.

              </h3>
              <p>
                From a technical perspective, the large hero video negatively
                impacts speed. On the positive side, the site’s semantics are
                solid: sections like “Our Process” and “Our Foods” are clearly
                defined, the navigation uses standard anchor links, and legal or
                privacy links are placed in the footer, which is good. The
                embedded video (“Watch Episode”) may add extra load, but with
                proper optimization, it shouldn’t significantly affect
                performance.

                Excellence Criteria (Creativity, Content, UX)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The site excels in creativity, content, and UX by combining a
                brand voice with clear purpose. The positioning “Real fats, real
                flavor”, paired with a message of sustainability gives the brand
                a strong, memorable identity. The concept of delivering foods
                people love but made differently feels fresh and creative.
                Content-wise, the site covers everything: the product, its
                process, and the mission, providing a complete picture of what
                the brand is, why it matters, and how it’s made. The inclusion
                of a “Journal” adds ongoing storytelling, fostering community
                and transparency. The design is user-friendly, with clear
                navigation, readable text, and compelling imagery. Calls to
                action like “Join Now” or the newsletter are easy to find, and
                the overall user journey, from understanding the product and its
                values to learning how to get involved or purchase, is logical
                and intuitive, especially for those interested in sustainable
                food.

              <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Very clear mission + messaging. You immediately understand
                  what Savor is about.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strong branding: ethical, natural, modern. The visual + copy
                  reinforce each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Good structural layout: hero → process → product → social
                  proof (press) → community (journal, newsletter).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transparency: mission, terms/privacy, press kit, etc. are
                  visible.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Performance risk: many images, possibly video, plus high
                  fidelity visuals can slow load times, especially on mobile or
                  weaker networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility risk: images needs alt text; overlays or
                  background-image text could reduce readability. If video lacks
                  captions or accessible controls, that's a concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engagement risk: if visitors don't immediately find what they
                  want (pricing, shop), there may be friction. The "Foods" page
                  is present but depending on how it's organized could be deep.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p><strong>Learnings:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Combining product + mission is powerful; being explicit about
                  what you don't do is as informative as what you do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visual richness enhances branding but must be balanced with
                  performance optimization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transparent navigation (including legal, press, etc.) builds
                  trust.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintaining clarity while preserving brand voice is a strong
                  asset.

              <p>
                I chose this website as it’ is a portfolio site by a “Creative
                Developer” in which he portrays his identity through the website
                combining coding + design. The “Projects” section gives a good
                cross-section of work; its structure, presentation, and layout
                are likely to reveal how Stefan wants to position himself
                professionally. The website is relevant for comparing how
                individual creatives organize & present work.

                The website is professional, clean, and minimalist. The page
                gives off a sense of precision & clarity. There is a strong
                sense of craftsmanship: the interface seems thought-through,
                purposeful, which gives credibility.

              <p>
                The page is a list of projects. Each project is given a title;
                it appears as clickable interactive elements (linking to more
                detail). Also there is header navigation: Intro / Projects /
                About. And the contact info is present on the left corner below.
                There is page numbering “01 /19” that tells the user in which
                project they are. Thus, structure is straightforward: the
                projects are primary content, preceded by navigation and
                accompanied by contact.

                Visual (Palette, Typography, Branding)
              </h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Palette:</strong> The color palette leans toward
                monochrome, letting project thumbnails and content stand out.
                The emphasis seems on clarity rather than decorative color. The
                background is clean (white) with dark/black typography.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Typography:</strong> There is clear hierarchy: project
                names are prominent; navigation items are less prominent but
                visible. The Font choice is modern, sans serif, clean and
                readable.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Branding:</strong> The brand is “Stefan Vitasović” its
                positioning is clear: international, creative & technical
                competence. His projects are high-profile and varied, which
                underscores versatility. And the “Available for freelance
                projects” line emphasizes openness and availability, reinforcing
                that this is both portfolio and call to action.

                Interaction (Animations, Effects, Microinteractions)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The "01 /19" suggests that perhaps when you hover or click,
                project count / progress updates (a microinteraction). Likely
                hover feedback on project items (e.g. image or title
                animations). Possibly smooth page transitions, or project detail
                overlays. The navigation items (Intro / Projects / About)
                probably have hover or selection states. Though from the static
                source I saw, I didn't observe JS code or specific animations;
                but typical portfolio-sites of this style often employ subtle
                transitions.

                Usability (Clarity, Accessibility, Loading)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Very clear what this page is: "Projects." Users know where they
                are, can see what kinds of work is done. Project names are
                descriptive; client names or project types often included. From
                source snippet, I can't confirm presence of alt-text for images
                (if images are involved) or whether keyboard navigation is
                robust. The text is likely well contrastive (dark on light).
                Listing of 19 items is moderate; if project items include large
                images, that could slow things, but if thumbnails are optimized
                / lazy loaded, then likely acceptable. Because the design is
                minimal, initial paint likely quick.

                Technical (Speed, Semantics, Core Web Vitals)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Semantics: The HTML class / tags seem to use sectioning (list of
                projects), headings ("## …") etc. That helps. The "Available for
                freelance projects" line in source is plainly in text, good for
                semantics. Core Web Vitals possible issues: LCP if a large
                project image or banner loads; CLS if layout shifts when images
                load; FID/INP is probably low risk if interactions are light.
                Also the count "/19" indicates dynamic behavior; making sure
                that dynamic content doesn't block rendering or interactivity is
                important.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The design is polished and restrained. The creativity lies in
                selection of projects, variety, and clean presentation rather
                than flashy visuals. The "progress count" (01/19) is a nice
                touch, giving you a sense of scale, progress, discovery. Good
                mix of project names; likely each has case studies or detail
                pages. The titles span various industries / types. Contact info
                and credentials are visible, making conversion / outreach easy.
                Likely smooth, easy to navigate: clear sections; clicking to
                project detail; ability to contact. Minimal distractions; visual
                hierarchy likely supports quick scanning. The navigation is
                simple but effective.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Potential lack of descriptive preview / thumbnails: if project
                  titles alone are shown (without images or brief summaries),
                  users might be less motivated to click.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Accessibility / performance could be challenging if images are
                  large or not optimized.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Might feel perhaps "safe" rather than adventurous; less visual
